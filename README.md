#the given problem statement is :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task
Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

If n  is odd, print Weird
If n  is even and in the inclusive range of 2  to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer,n .

Constraints
1<=n<=100

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Explanation 0
n = 3

n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.

Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation 1

n = 24
n>20 and n is even, so it is not weird.

=================================================================================================================================
prefered solution is : 

Python 2
--------

n = int(raw_input())
if n % 2 == 1:
    print "Weird"
elif n % 2 == 0 and 2 <= n <= 5:
    print "Not Weird"
elif n % 2 == 0 and 6 <= n <= 20:
    print "Weird"
else:
    print "Not Weird"
    
Python 3
---------

n = int(input())
if n % 2:
    print("Weird")
elif 2 <= n <= 5:
    print("Not Weird")
elif 6 <= n <= 20:
    print("Weird")
else:
    print("Not Weird")
